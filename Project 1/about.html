        <img src="images/phil.jpg" alt="company photo">
    <p> Established in 2007, we have grown into an amazing company that constantly seeks to make drivers' satisfaction our number 1 priority for over 13 years. 
        Our founder, Joe Philbert was drawn to the automotive industry from the young age of 16 years old and by the age of 20 he started renting out an old garage his neighbours no longer used. He partnered with two of his best pals, Mike Sammy and Dean Sammy, who worked tirelessly by his side thinking of more ways to gain more customers and expand the business. Today, this company is all the physical evidence you need of their success story. With Joe, Mike and Dean, we have grown 40 members strong, who are all trained and well equiped to make you, a happy, returning customer.</p>
